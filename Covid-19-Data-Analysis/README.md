📌 In this project, I gathered reliable COVID-19 datasets from trusted sources and conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover key insights about the pandemic. Here's my approach:

📝 Data Collection: Sourced relevant COVID-19 datasets from government health agencies and reputable data repositories.
🌐 Data Cleaning & Preparation: Processed the data by handling missing values and ensuring a structured format for analysis.
🧹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraged Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize trends and identify patterns.
🪄 Feature Engineering: Derived meaningful metrics such as daily new cases and growth rates to enrich the analysis.
⚒️ Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical techniques to assess correlations, conduct hypothesis testing, and identify significant factors influencing COVID-19 spread.
